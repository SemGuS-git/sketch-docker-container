This repository is intended as a convenient way of running Sketch on ARM MacOS, where native compilation is currently difficult.

We have included a copy of the archive file containing a pre-built version of Sketch; this is intended to preserve access in the event that the Sketch repositories become unavailable.

For more on Sketch, see its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/asolarlez/sketch-frontend).

### Installation

We suggest building the container using the included `build` script, which sets the container's name to `wiley/sketch`. You can then add the `scripts` folder to your PATH, which will allow you to invoke the `sketch` command as if you were running Sketch locally (for the most part).
